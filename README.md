## :snowflake: My NixOS flake (WIP)

My personal, highly declarative, nix flake configured using home-manager. This is a WIP, 
and is not garanteed to work on all machines just yet. Feel free to take inspiration from
my configuration.

# Using this config
If you do choose to use this config there are some things you need to consider.

- Hyprland is not setup through hyprland. You need to create your own hyprland.conf

TODO
- Setup my Hyprland config using home-manager
- Setup Fish config declaratively
- Add background to waybar for readibility
- Add icons to wlogout
- Have SDDM boot into a custom theme
- Create a cava theme
- Further customize zathura
- Further customize nvim
- Add a user for laptop
